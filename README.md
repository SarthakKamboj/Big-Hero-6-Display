I used vanilla JavaScript to create a small webpage that shows a trailer of the popular movie Big Hero 6 and mentions the financial success it had worldwide. During the process, I introduced myself to Webpack and the Webpack CLI, including how to setup specific configuration settings and the proper directory structure. I also created a number counting animation on load and a mobile friendly toggle bar which made the rest of the webpage slightly opaque.

This project taught me the importance of Webpack, especially as certain projects become more sizeable and the power of an organized file structure. I understood how Webpack looks for an entry JavaScript file and creates a dependency graph based on the imports within these files.

This project also showed me how a few animations can bring a webpage to life and make it much more appealing.
